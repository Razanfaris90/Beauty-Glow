<h2 class="color2">Curly Hair</h2>
   <p class="Pstyle">Decoding your curl type can be confusing, we feel you. Several different textures can exist on one head of curly hair, which all have to somehow look cohesive when you style it. When the strands at your crown are looser than the ones on the sides, and even more different than the hair in the back, it's easy to just throw up your hands in frustration and contemplate shaving it all off. Which you can totally do!</p>

<p class="Pstyle">after knowing your hair type and what product you could use with it. NOW let me tell you about some tricks that will make you look magical </p>

<!--this line print unourderd list and the style by using the class -->
<div class="container">
  <ul class="myUL">

<li><b>Only wash your hair when needed.</b>Washing curly hair too often can leave it dry, frizzy, and hard to manage. Thick, curly hair doesn’t need to be washed daily or even weekly. However, you should wash your hair a minimum of every 2 to 3 weeks for optimal scalp and hair health. If your hair is long or thick, wash it in sections to reduce damage or tangling.</li>

<li><b>Keep your hair moisturized.</b>Curly hair is drier than other hair types. To keep it moisturized, condition all your hair, not just the ends. Apply a thick conditioner after washing your hair. Then, apply oil or leave-in conditioner after you have finished washing and conditioning your hair to assist with moisturization.</li>

<li><b>Care for your hair while you sleep.</b>If you’re able, you can pull your hair into a loose ponytail on top of your head (resembling a pineapple) or a loose braid before sleeping to preserve your curls and reduce friction against your pillowcase, which can make your hair frizzy and easier to break.</li>

<li><b>Protect your curls from the sun.</b>Heat and the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays can dry out curly hair. To protect your curls, cover up with a wide-brimmed hat and keep your hair moisturized.</li>

<li><b>Detangle your hair.</b>Curly hair gets knotted easily. To detangle between washes, wet your hair thoroughly and apply a leave-in conditioner and detangle with your fingers or a wide-toothed comb and/or brush designed for curly or coily hair. Work in sections to make detangling easier. Avoid brushing your hair while it is dry to prevent your hair from breaking and frizzing. Make sure to detangle while washing your hair, too.</li>
