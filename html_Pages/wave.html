<h2 class="color2">Wavy Hair</h2>
   <p class="Pstyle">Decoding your curl type can be confusing, we feel you. Several different textures can exist on one head of curly hair, which all have to somehow look cohesive when you style it. When the strands at your crown are looser than the ones on the sides, and even more different than the hair in the back, it's easy to just throw up your hands in frustration and contemplate shaving it all off. Which you can totally do!</p>

<!--this line print unourderd list and the style by using the class -->
  <ul class="myUL">

<li><b>Keep your hair moisture-rich.</b> If your hair’s hydrated, you’ll notice the difference. Our Miracle Moist collection, infused with Australian Macadamia Nut Oil, will give those waves the moisture boost they deserve. Perfect for hair that’s as a thirsty as a tourist lost in the outback!
</li>
<li><b>Wave goodbye to over-styling.</b>If you want to keep the curl all day long, you don’t need to take to your hair with curling tongs and styling product. In fact, you shouldn’t. Learn how to style wavy hair without damaging it. Heat and overuse of styling products can leave your hair looking frizzy, damaged or weighed down.
</li>
<li><b>Comb with your fingers.</b>Comb with your fingers. Yep! If you gently comb through your hair using your fingers, it will pull less and help to maintain that wavy definition.
</li>

<li><b>Keep it cool.</b> Lower temperatures are best for keeping the curl and avoiding the frizz. So, lock the moisture in using the right wavy hair products and keep the styling tools on low heat.
</li>

<li><b>Pin it up.</b> Use a few pins or a tie to keep your hair up and in shape. Carefully pin those waves into place and show off that wavy up-do.
</li>
  </ul>
