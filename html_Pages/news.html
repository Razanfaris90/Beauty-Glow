                        <p>Our skin is a dynamic organ, sensitive to environmental shifts and maintaining its
                            health is paramount but fluctuations in weather, such as transitioning from hot and humid to
                            cold
                            and
                            dry conditions, can disrupt the delicate moisture balance of the skin, resulting in dryness,
                            irritation and even breakouts. To counter these effects, it is vital to maintain proper
                            hydration, provide adequate moisturisation and employ suitable skincare routines.
                            Neglecting seasonal skincare adjustments can compromise the skin's barrier function,
                            accelerating

                            signs of aging and diminishing its overall health and appearance. Adapting your skincare
                            regimen
                            to
                            the changing weather can help you maintain healthy and radiant skin throughout the year.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Nutrition Matters</h3>
                        <p>Eating right is super important for your skin, especially when the weather is all over the
                            place. One of the important nutrients in Almonds. Almonds can make your skin look better by
                            reducing wrinkles and giving it a natural glow. They have healthy fats that keep your skin
                            nourished and hydrated, which is important when the weather makes your skin dry. Almonds are
                            also rich in vitamin E, especially alpha-tocopherol, a powerful antioxidant that fights
                            signs of ageing and keeps your skin looking young and radiant.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Tailor Your Cleanser</h3>
                        <p>Choosing the right cleanser for your skin is essential, especially when dealing with
                            different weather conditions. During the winter months or in cold, dry climates, your skin
                            is more prone to dehydration and sensitivity. Opt for a gentle, hydrating cleanser with a
                            creamy or lotion-like texture. These cleansers are designed to clean your skin without
                            stripping away its natural oils. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin or
                            ceramides, which help lock in moisture and prevent dryness. In contrast, hot and humid
                            weather can lead to excess oil production and potential breakouts. Choose a foaming or
                            gel-based cleanser that can effectively remove excess oil and sweat without over-drying your
                            skin. Cleansers with ingredients like salicylic acid or tea tree oil, which have natural
                            astringent properties to help control oil and prevent breakouts will be an ideal option.
                        </p>



                        <h3>Daily Sunscreen</h3>
                        <p>Sunscreen is your best defense against premature aging and skin damage caused by UV
                            radiation. UV radiation comes in two forms, UVA and UVB. UVA rays can prematurely age your
                            skin, while UVB rays can cause sunburn. To protect against both, choose a sunscreen labeled
                            as "broad-spectrum." This means it offers protection against both types of UV rays. We
                            should always use sunscreen with an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of 30 or higher. SPF 30
                            filters out about 97% of UVB rays. Higher SPFs offer slightly more protection, but there is
                            no sunscreen that provides 100% protection, so reapplication is crucial. If you have
                            sensitive skin, mineral sunscreens are often a safer choice.
                        </p>


                        <h3>Hydrate Inside and Out</h3>
                        <p>Hydration is the cornerstone of healthy skin. Staying adequately hydrated from within is
                            essential. Water helps maintain your skin's moisture balance and supports overall skin
                            health. Aim to drink at least eight glasses of water a day, and more if you are active or in
                            hot weather. Incorporating almond-based products into your skincare routine can provide
                            additional hydration and nourishment. Almond oil, for example, is rich in essential fatty
                            acids that help lock in moisture and keep your skin supple. You can use almond oil as a
                            moisturizer or look for skincare products that contain almond extract. They provide deep
                            hydration, nourishment, and a healthy glow to your skin.
                        </p>


                        <p>Remember that skincare is not one-size-fits-all, so it is always a good idea to consult with
                            a
                            dermatologist for personalised advice. With the right care, your skin can confidently face
                            any
                            weather transition, and you will be well on your way to achieving the skin you have always
                            dreamed of.</p>

                        purple
                        blooming flowers, and flowing pink rosé, colors somehow seem brighter during warmer
                        months.<br>
                        This year, you'll find us rocking a bold watercolor tear duct eyeshadow for an
                        unexpected pop of
                        color.<br> It looks as great with natural glam as it does with a bold face beat, and it
                        requires
                        minimal makeup skills to apply—simply sweep your chosen hue onto the inner third of your
                        eyes,
                        blend it out, and you're good to go.<br> Scroll on for 10 watercolor tear duct eyeshadow
                        moments
                        we'll be copying all summer long.<br></p>

                            <img src="images/mainNews2.webp" alt="family cares about their skin">
                            <p>If you're not ready to commit to a full-on, bold look, opt for natural base with a pastel
                                pop
                                of color in the inner corner.<br>
                                Simply swipe on a watercolor hue over the inner third of the eye area—we love how this
                                light
                                blue shade brings out the eyes.</p>

                            <img src="images/new2photo2.webp" alt="family cares about their skin">
                            <p>Look for an iridescent, light shade that can double as an inner-corner highlight.<br>
                                Purple always makes a statement, yet this shade also feels like a natural fit alongside
                                this
                                dewy glam makeup look.</p>

                            <p>A warm shade like orange is great for a subtle pop of color.<br>
                                This look pairs tangerine watercolor tear duct eyeshadow with Barbie pink lips and a
                                radiant
                                complexion.</p>

                            <li>Watercolor and Wings</li>
                            <img src="images/new2photo4.webp" alt="family cares about their skin">
                            <p>For a big impact, pair your watercolor tear duct eyeshadow with a complementary shade of
                                winged liner.<br>
                                For this look on Rico Nasty, makeup artist Steve Kassajikian used Urban Decay's 24/7
                                Inks
                                Eyeliner Pen ($26) in Freak alongside the bright chartreuse inner corner.</p>

                            <img src="images/new2photo5.webp" alt="family cares about their skin">
                            <p>An ombré eyeshadow look, like this one from blue to purple, creates a natural progression
                                into a watercolor tear duct.</p>

                                here.<br>
                                She wears a neon rainbow-inspired spectrum, but you can choose whichever color scheme
                                you
                                desire.

                            <p>If you're looking to make your inner corner color really stand out, layer a vivid shade
                                over
                                a lighter hue and keep the rest of the eye in neutral tones.<br>
                                We love this cut crease take on the look.
                            </p>

                            <li>Shine Bright</li>

                                mood board.<br>
                                Add thick black winged liner to bring the glam.
                            </p>

                            <p>Between the gold, deep pink, and blue, this watercolor tear duct eyeshadow look is
                                perfect
                                for a summer event.<br>
                                Keep the rest of the makeup fairly natural to really let the vivid hues stand out.
                            </p>

                            <li>Green With Envy</li>

                            <p>Pink and green might not be your go-to color combo, but this pixie-inspired look is sure
                                to

                                Pro tip: For extra oomph, bring your inner corner color down to the lower lash line.
