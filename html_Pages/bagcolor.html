        <h2 class="pink-bg">WHAT IS COLOR THEORY?</h2>
        <h4 class="white-bg">Color theory is a fundamental aspect of design, art, and aesthetics that explores how
            colors interact, evoke
            emotions, and communicate messages. Understanding color theory allows us to make intentional choices when it
            comes to color. <br> In this guide, we will dive into the world of color, exploring how to achieve the
            girly girl vibe.</h4>

        <h2 class="pink-bg">COLOR THEORY TYPS:</h2>

        </div>
        <h2 class="pink-bg">Split-Complementary Color</h2>

        <h4 class="white-bg">A split-complementary color scheme is known to be a variation of a complementary color
            scheme.But
            rather than being a mixture of two colors, split-complementary colors contain a combination of three colors.
        </h4>

        <h2 class="pink-bg">Triadic Color</h2>

        <h4 class="white-bg">A triadic color scheme consists of three colors. Unlike colors that sit next to or directly
            across each
            other, triadic colors are equidistant on the color wheel. When you join these colors, they form a triangle.
        </h4>

        <h2 class="pink-bg">Analogous</h2>

        <h4 class="white-bg">These color schemes are most often seen in nature.For example, during the fall, one might
            often see the
            changing leaves form an analogous sort of color scheme, progressively moving through the color wheel to
            create
            a gradient in its natural pattern.
        </h4>

        <h2 class="pink-bg">Double Complementary</h2>

        <h4 class="white-bg">In a double complementary scheme, we use a combination of four colors that, as the name
            implies, is made up
            of two complementary color pairs.<br>(Remember, two colors are complementary if they are opposite each other
            on the color wheel.)<br>To make it even easier, this kind of color combination is also known as rectangular
            colors because when the four colors are connected on the color wheel they form a rectangle.

        <h4 class="white-bg">Have you ever heard about "Personal Colour"? It's color analysis, also known as personal
            color analysis
            (PCA), seasonal color analysis, or skin-tone matching, is a term often used within the cosmetics and fashion
            industry to describe a method of determining the colors of clothing and makeup that harmonize with a

            skin complexion, eye color, and hair color with the benefit of being able to use this tool for wardrobe
            planning and style consulting.
